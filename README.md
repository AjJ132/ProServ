## Introduction
Welcome to ProServ, an evolving communication platform designed to bridge the gap between coaches and athletes. This application, although a work in progress, aims to streamline the distribution of workouts and improve overall communication within athletic teams.

As a student software engineer, this project allows me to dive into various aspects of full-stack development, focusing primarily on C# technologies like Blazor for the frontend and ASP.NET for the backend. The accompanying mobile iOS app brings added versatility to the platform.

## Features
- User Login
- Workout distribution
- Mobile app
- Secure backend API endpoints
- Fully deployable in Azure with CI/CD pipeline

## Technologies Used
- Azure SQL Database
